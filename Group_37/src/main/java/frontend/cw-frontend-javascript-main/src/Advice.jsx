      question: "How are UK university degree classifications calculated, and how do they convert to GPA?",

          UK universities classify degrees as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>First-Class Honours (1st): 70% and above</li>
            <li>Upper Second-Class Honours (2:1): 60% â€“ 69%</li>
            <li>Lower Second-Class Honours (2:2): 50% â€“ 59%</li>
            <li>Third-Class Honours (3rd): 40% â€“ 49%</li>
          </ul>
          These classifications are based on the weighted average of your module marks. Converting UK classifications to the US GPA system varies, but a general guideline is:
          <ul>
            <li>First-Class Honours (1st): 3.7 â€“ 4.0 GPA</li>
            <li>Upper Second-Class Honours (2:1): 3.3 â€“ 3.6 GPA</li>

            <li>Third-Class Honours (3rd): 2.0 â€“ 2.6 GPA</li>
